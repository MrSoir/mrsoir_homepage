Render Entire File Structures
with Kubu you can load and render entire file structures. There's no need anymore to jump from folder to folder to find your files. You can observe all files at a glance.

Kubu puts emphasis on a clean and tidy look. This is achieved by a smart way of rendering, e.g. buttons are displayed only when they are needed. As a result, most of the screen size is utilized for displaying content.
