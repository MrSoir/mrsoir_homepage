Render Entire File Structures
with Kubu you can load and render entire tree structures. Thus, you don't have to jump from folder to folder. You can observe all files at a glance.

Kubu puts emphasis on a clean and tidy look. This is achieved by a smart way of rendering (e.g. buttons are displayed context-dependent). As a result, most of the screen size is utilized for displaying content.
